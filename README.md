### Hello fellow nerds ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub profile is where I upload and organize most of my coding projects. If you are someone of the marvelous kind of species that can write flawless code, please feel free to either post a squillion pull requests or shake your head silently about my stupid mistakes. ðŸ˜…

**I am currently working on:** [Visualizations of the election polls for Germany's general election for the last two centuries](https://github.com/dominiklawetzky/sonntagsfrage) / [Shiny app plotting COVID data for my administrative district](https://github.com/dominiklawetzky/covid-rheingau-taunus)

**I am currently learning:** ... to write more efficient _R_ code. Moreover, I aim at betting understanding APIs and how to use them efficiently (with SQL)._

**Connect with me:** If you prefer quick replies (and who does not!), contact me over Twitter. Otherwise, write an email to info\[at\]dominiklawetzky\[dot\]de (PGP fingerprint: 3682 DB1D EBAA 3FE1).
